⚠️ Ownership & Purpose

This project was designed and built entirely by me, Brooke Addison, as both a personal portfolio piece and the early-stage foundation of a real initiative I'm actively developing.

While you're welcome to browse and learn from the code, this project is not open for copying, forking, or external contributions.

Undercoders is more than a template — it's a vision in motion.
